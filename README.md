# CryptoCurrencies
With the use of VS Code, Machine Learning, Pandas, HV Plot, KMeans, and PCA, I will create a classification system to group together cryptocurrencies that are on the trading market.

# Overview
Accountability Accounting, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. The company, however, is lost in the vast universe of cryptocurrencies. So, they’ve asked you to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

- Deliverable 1: Using my knowledge of Pandas, I’ll preprocess the dataset in order to perform PCA in Deliverable 2
- Deliverable 2: Using my knowledge of how to apply the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm, I’ll reduce the dimensions of the X DataFrame to three principal components and place these dimensions in a new DataFrame.
- Deliverable 3: Using my knowledge of the K-means algorithm, I’ll create an elbow curve using hvPlot to find the best value for K from the pcs_df DataFrame created in Deliverable 2. Then, I’ll run the K-means algorithm to predict the K clusters for the cryptocurrencies’ data
- Deliverable 4: Using my knowledge of creating scatter plots with Plotly Express and hvplot, I’ll visualize the distinct groups that correspond to the three principal components I created in Deliverable 2, then I’ll create a table with all the currently tradable cryptocurrencies using the hvplot.table() function.
